# Documentation

## 1. Don't Duplicate

**One source of truth per fact. Everything else links.**

- Before writing, check if the information already exists. If it does, link to it.
- If two files say the same thing, delete one and point to the other.
- README, comments, docstrings, and commit messages serve different purposes. Don't repeat content across them.
- If you find yourself copying a paragraph, you're creating a future contradiction.

## 2. Keep It Short

**Say it once, say it clearly, stop.**

- One topic per page. If a doc covers two unrelated things, split it.
- Cut filler: "it should be noted that", "in order to", "as mentioned above." Just state the thing.
- One code example beats a paragraph of explanation.
- If a page exceeds 150 lines, it's probably two pages.

## 3. Don't Let Docs Rot

**Stale docs are worse than no docs.**

- When you change code, update the docs that describe it in the same change.
- If you find a doc that contradicts the code, fix or delete it immediately.
- Don't leave commented-out content, TODO placeholders, or "will be updated later" notes. They never get updated.
- Outdated docs actively mislead. Absence is safer than inaccuracy.

## 4. Don't Create Docs Nobody Asked For

**Docs solve real problems. They are not a deliverable.**

- Don't proactively generate README files, architecture docs, or guides unless requested.
- Don't write a page that restates what another page already covers. Link instead.
- Don't document internal implementation details that only matter if you're reading the source.
- If you wouldn't read it, don't write it.

## 5. Be Precise

**Vague docs create vague understanding.**

- Use exact names: file paths, function names, CLI commands. Not "the config file" — which one?
- Replace vague pronouns ("it", "this", "that") with the explicit noun when ambiguous.
- Use consistent terminology. Pick one term per concept and stick with it project-wide.
- Concrete over abstract: specific values, real examples, actual commands.
