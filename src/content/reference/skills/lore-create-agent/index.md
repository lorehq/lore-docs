# Create Agent

Operator agents are optional static delegation patterns. The harness provides `lore-worker` for general delegation — this skill is for creating additional operator-owned agents when a recurring task pattern benefits from a pre-packaged agent.

## When to Create

- You have a recurring delegation pattern that benefits from pre-packaged context
- The same set of skills, rules, and scope boundaries apply every time
- A static agent definition is more efficient than the orchestrator assembling context each time

## Process

### Step 1: Check Existing Agents

Scan `.lore/agents/`. If an agent exists for the purpose, update it. Otherwise create new.

### Step 2: Create Agent File

**Location**: `.lore/agents/<purpose>-agent.md`

```markdown

name: <purpose>-agent
description: <Purpose> operations specialist.
tier: default
skills:
  - <skill-name>

# <Purpose> Agent

Handles <purpose> operations.

## Subagent Operating Rules
- You are a delegated subagent, not the orchestrator. Stay within delegated scope and return concise results.
- Before implementation, always load project guidance from `docs/context/agent-rules.md` and relevant files under `.lore/rules/`.
- Follow repo boundaries from agent rules (Lore hub for knowledge; application code in external repos).
- If scope has independent branches, run them in parallel subagents; keep dependency-gated steps sequential.

## Self-Learning
- Non-obvious snag (gotcha, quirk) during execution -> create or update a fieldnote under `.lore/fieldnotes/`.
- New environment facts -> update `docs/knowledge/environment/`.
- Multi-step procedures discovered -> add/update `.lore/runbooks/`.

## Available Skills
- `<skill-name>`
```

The `tier` field (`fast`, `default`, or `powerful`) is resolved to a platform-specific model at generation time using `subagentDefaults` in `.lore/config.json`. Omit `tier` to default to `default`.

### Step 3: Sync Platform Copies

```bash
bash .lore/harness/scripts/sync-platform-skills.sh
```

## Naming

Pattern: `<purpose>-agent` (e.g., `deploy-agent`, `infra-agent`, `docs-agent`). Lowercase, kebab-case.

**Do not use the `lore-` prefix** — that's reserved for harness agents (`lore-worker`). Operator agents use descriptive names without the prefix.
