# Configuration

Lore reads settings from `.lore/config.json` (JSON) at the instance root and from environment variables.

## `.lore/config.json`

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "treeDepth": 5,
  "nudgeThreshold": 3,
  "warnThreshold": 5,
  "profile": "standard"
}
```

### Fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `version` | string | -- | Displayed in the session banner (`=== LORE v1.0.0 ===`) |
| `treeDepth` | number | `5` | Max directory depth in the knowledge map tree |
| `nudgeThreshold` | number | `3` | Bash commands before a gentle capture reminder |
| `warnThreshold` | number | `5` | Bash commands before a strong capture warning |
| `profile` | string | `"standard"` | Hook behavior profile. See [Hook Profile](#hook-profile). |

All fields are optional. Missing fields fall back to defaults. If `.lore/config.json` is missing or contains a parse error, all fields silently fall back to defaults — no error is thrown.

**Metadata fields** — `name` and `created` are informational, set during instance creation. Not used by framework logic.

### `subagentDefaults`

Controls which worker agent tiers are generated and which model each tier uses in Claude Code.

```json
{
  "subagentDefaults": {
    "claude": {
      "fast": "claude-haiku-4-5",
      "default": "claude-sonnet-4-5",
      "powerful": "claude-opus-4-5"
    }
  }
}
```

`subagentDefaults.claude` accepts up to three tier keys:

| Key | Generated agent | Description |
|-----|----------------|-------------|
| `default` | `lore-worker` (always generated) | Standard worker. Uses `claude.default` model if set; omits model field otherwise (platform picks its own default). |
| `fast` | `lore-worker-fast` (only when key is set) | Lightweight worker for cheap, parallelizable tasks. |
| `powerful` | `lore-worker-powerful` (only when key is set) | High-capability worker for complex reasoning tasks. |

`lore-worker` is always generated by `sync-platform-skills.sh`. `lore-worker-fast` and `lore-worker-powerful` are only generated when their respective tier key is present in the config.

Model values use vendor-native identifiers — no translation is performed.

### Hook Profile

Controls which hook behaviors are active for the session.

```json
{
  "profile": "discovery"
}
```

Any unrecognized value (or a missing `profile` key) falls back to `standard`.

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `standard` | Default. All hooks active. Capture nudges at normal thresholds. |
| `minimal` | Per-tool nudges off. Session banner notes to use `/lore-capture` manually. Use when hooks feel noisy. |
| `discovery` | All hooks active. Banner adds aggressive capture instructions for environment mapping and skill creation. Use during initial setup or unfamiliar codebase exploration. |

## Tuning for Large Instances

The largest contributor to session banner size is the **knowledge map** — a directory-only tree of `docs/`, `skills/`, and `agents/`. Size grows with the number of directories, not documents.

**`treeDepth`** limits how many directory levels the knowledge map displays. Default is 5. Reducing to 3 or 4 hides deep nesting while showing top-level structure.

**When to act:**

- Knowledge map exceeds ~50 lines → reduce `treeDepth` or reorganize subdirectories
- `MEMORY.local.md` exceeds ~50 lines → route content to skills or `docs/knowledge/`
- Conventions section growing → keep it focused on rules, move reference material to `docs/knowledge/`
- Many active work items → archive completed items with `/lore-capture`

> Archived items (in `archive/` subdirectories) are excluded from the knowledge map tree — they do not appear in the session banner. This keeps the map focused on active content.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `LORE_DEBUG=1` | Enable debug logging to stderr |
| `LORE_HOOK_LOG=1` | Enable structured hook event logging to `.git/lore-hook-events.jsonl` |
| `LORE_HUB` | Internal. Set by `/lore-link` to point cross-repo hooks back to the hub |

### Hook Event Logging

`LORE_HOOK_LOG` enables structured event logging for all hooks across all three platforms. Each hook fire writes a JSON line to `.git/lore-hook-events.jsonl`. Zero cost when disabled.

```bash
export LORE_HOOK_LOG=1
```

Each entry records:

```json
{"ts": 1740000000000, "platform": "cursor", "hook": "capture-nudge", "event": "beforeShellExecution", "output_size": 52, "state": {"bash": 3}}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `ts` | Unix epoch milliseconds |
| `platform` | `claude`, `cursor`, or `opencode` |
| `hook` | Hook filename (e.g., `capture-nudge`, `session-init`) |
| `event` | Platform event name (e.g., `beforeShellExecution`, `PostToolUse`) |
| `output_size` | Characters injected into the agent's context (0 for silent hooks) |
| `state` | Optional hook-specific snapshot (bash counter, flags) |

Analyze collected data:

```bash
bash .lore/scripts/analyze-hook-logs.sh
```

The report shows fires per platform, fires per hook, average output sizes, estimated accumulated context tokens, and any hooks that never fired. To reset: `rm .git/lore-hook-events.jsonl`.
