# Plans

The `plans/` directory holds tactical work items scoped to days or weeks. Plans can be standalone or nested under a roadmap folder. Active plans appear in the session banner; completed or cancelled plans move to `plans/archive/`. See [Roadmaps & Plans](../../guides/roadmaps-and-plans.md) for format and status workflow.
