# Work

The `work/` directory tracks active and archived work items: strategic roadmaps, tactical plans, and exploratory brainstorms. All work items are operator-initiated — Lore maintains them but asks before creating or updating. Active roadmaps and plans surface in the session banner so long-running projects always have context at startup.
