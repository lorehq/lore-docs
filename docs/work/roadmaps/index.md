# Roadmaps

The `roadmaps/` directory holds strategic initiatives scoped to weeks or months. Each roadmap tracks overall progress across phases and contains nested `plans/` and `archive/` folders. Active roadmaps appear in the session banner every session. See [Roadmaps & Plans](../../guides/roadmaps-and-plans.md) for format and status workflow.
