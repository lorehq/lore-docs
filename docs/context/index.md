# Context

The `context/` directory holds files that are injected into every agent session as project context. `agent-rules.md` describes the project and sets agent behavior constraints; the `conventions/` subdirectory holds coding and documentation standards. Together these files ensure the agent has consistent grounding before your first prompt.

- [Agent Rules](agent-rules.md)
- [Conventions](conventions/index.md)
