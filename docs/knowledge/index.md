# Knowledge

The `knowledge/` directory is where Lore stores everything discovered during sessions: environment facts, reusable runbooks, and operator-local preferences. Unlike `context/`, knowledge files are written by the agent as it learns — not pre-authored upfront.

- [Runbooks](runbooks/index.md)
